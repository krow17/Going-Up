# Going-Up
Semester-long virtual reality project. Premise is to travel through multiple floors of a seemingly abandoned mental ward, and either ignore or obey voices that the player hears.

# How to play
Made with HTC Vive in mind, but can be played without. Vive configuration should be for Room-Space, with a regularly-shpaed play area.  Navigation is achieved by using an Xbox One or similarly mapped PS4 controller. 

REQUIREMENTS FOR USING VIVE:
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or better

CPU: Intel i5-4590, AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better

RAM: 4 GB or more

Video Output: HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 or newer

USB Port: 1x USB 2.0 or better port

Operating System: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1 or later, Windows 10

# Desired Updates
--> UI: Have since learned how to correctly display prompts and text in game. Would like to go back through and implement that. 

--> Navigation: Have since become familiar with Vive controller input. Would like to replace Xbox One controller with native controllers.

--> Beware wall clipping. Unity doesn't stop you from physically "moving" your head through objects.
